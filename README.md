# Heaven
WIP Garry's Mod framework for easy and proper gamemodes creation.

# Code guideline
Our code guide is based on javascript code practices.
1. Use camel case in variable names, table values, and anything else. (do not use the snake case anywhere or for any cost whatsoever, it's ugly)
2. Make full use of [LuaLS](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/LuaLanguageServer) wherever possible.
3. All data operations should not be performed by the game server, instead use a remote web server that will manage all data. (our framework is designed for this).

# Contributions
All Contributions to our project are welcome!\
Your changes should be useful, and they should also respect our [Code Guideline](#code-guideline).

# Recommendations
1. Use VSCode for development
2. **Host gmod game server on linux!!!**
